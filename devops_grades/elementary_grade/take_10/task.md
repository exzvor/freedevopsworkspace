## Nginx balancer
Describe a `Nginx` configuration where it will act as a balancer using upstream.

### Objectives:
1. Set secure shell authentication between machines.
2. Configure `Ansible` and install `Nginx` on machines.
3. Set configuration file for your balancer.

### Restrictions:
- Use three machines, for example, the main machine is `balancer` and two servers: `server1` & `server2`.
- Try to use `Fedora` on this take.
- Use cloud servers for this task.
