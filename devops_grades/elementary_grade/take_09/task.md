## Simple Ansible
Write an `Ansible` playbook, to configure the `Nginx` web server, which will configure firewall rules as well, opening ports `22`, `80`, `443`.

### Objectives:
1) Set secure shell authentication between machines.
2) Install ansible on the main machine.
3) Configure `inventory.ini`.
4) Create playbook and run it.

### Restrictions:
- Work with two machines, for example, the main machine is `test` and the work machine is `server`. All installations via `Ansible` must be done on the `server`.
- Try to use `CentOS7` on this take.
- Use cloud servers for this task.
