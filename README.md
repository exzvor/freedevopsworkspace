# About the project

## Free DevOps Workspace - practical material for effective DevOps immersion

### Main idea
Practice is the key to a deep understanding of the material. The material on this site is organized according to the principle:
1) Solving a practical problem independently
2) Compare with suggested solution
3) Learning theory from practice and self-check

### Repository content
The tasks on the repository are broken down by grades:
1) Elementary (trainee)
2) Base (Junior)
3) Intermediate (Junior+, Middle)
4) Advanced (Middle+)

If you are a novice engineer, it is recommended you to start with general engineering training before solving problems. Preparation includes familiarizing with computer networks,
Linux, and choosing a programming language. By the way you can start [here](https://github.com/exzvor/freedevopsworkspace/blob/main/intro/intro.md) to get familiar with some concepts.

### How to use
View the repository navigation below. Select the desired level and task. In folder with the take there are `README.md` that contains the task itself and `solution.md` in general case.

### UPD
Previously, the project aimed to provide a detailed guide for engineers at all levels. However, it has been recognized that for mid-level and senior engineers, and even for juniors, detailed instructions are not as relevant. They primarily need to understand the logic behind actions. Consequently, future tasks will be presented in the form of a manual, outlining key steps and commands.

### Collaboration
If you want to help in the development of the project, become a co-author of the workspace,
create interesting problems of any level and attach theoretical material to them.
Also, if you notice errors/inaccuracies/typos, write to me in the telegram [@exzvor](https://t.me/exzvor) or make a fork of the project and create a pull request.
