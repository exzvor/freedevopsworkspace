## Backup your data
Write a script that will create backup. Create a Cron entry to automatically run the script.

### Objectives:
1) Create any database with your data in `postgres`.
2) Write a `bash` script that will create backup.
3) Create a cron entry.
4) Cron should start the script every minute.

### Restrictions:
- Use `postgres` with this take.
- Redirect the script output so that you don't see any errors.
