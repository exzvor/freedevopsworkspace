## Create your own utility `ls`
Your team has a standalone test server. You have been tasked with developing `ls` utility to individually present data in order of `file name`, `file size` and `permissions`. Write the utility and embed it on your server.

### Objectives:
1) Write utility on your favorite programming language (I'd recommend `Go`, `Python` or `Java`).
2) Build your utility on server.
3) Add the utility to  environment variables.

### Restrictions:
- Your utility should work just like standard Linux utilities. For example, you just type `myls` and it gives you the result.

### What to learn:
- [What is `OS`, how it works](https://mattchw.medium.com/overview-of-operating-system-cc3f6f6bb062)
- [Get started with `Go`](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1), [`Python`](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/), [`Java`](https://dev.java/learn/getting-started/) or other language
- [Basic Linux commands (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, etc)](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands)
