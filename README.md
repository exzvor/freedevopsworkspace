# About the project

## Free DevOps Workspace - practical material for effective DevOps immersion

### Main idea
Practice is the key to a deep understanding of the material. The material on this site is organized according to the principle:
1) Solving a practical problem independently
2) Compare with suggested solution
3) Learning theory from practice and self-check

### Repository content
The tasks on the repository are broken down by grades:
1) Elementary (trainee)
2) Base (Junior)
3) Intermediate (Junior+, Middle)
4) Advanced (Middle+)

If you are a novice engineer, it is recommended you to start with general engineering training before solving problems. Preparation includes familiarizing with computer networks,
Linux, and choosing a programming language. By the way you can start [here](https://github.com/exzvor/freedevopsworkspace/blob/main/intro/intro.md) to get familiar with some concepts.

### How to use
View the repository navigation below. Select the desired level and task. In folder with the take there are `task.md` and `solution.md` in general case.

### Collaboration
If you want to help in the development of the project, become a co-author of the workspace,
create interesting problems of any level and attach theoretical material to them.
